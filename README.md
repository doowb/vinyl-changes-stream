> Create a changes stream from couchdb and turn docs into Vinyl objects.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save vinyl-changes-stream
```

## Usage

```js
var changes = require('vinyl-changes-stream');
```

## API

### [changes](index.js#L37)

Create a stream of [vinyl](https://github.com/gulpjs/vinyl) files from a couchdb changes stream provided by [changes-stream](https://github.com/jcrugzz/changes-stream). Files contain a stringified `change` object on `file.contents` and the raw JSON object on `file.json`. `file.id` and `file.seq` are also populated with the `.id` and `.seq` from the `change` object.

**Params**

* `options` **{Object|String}**: Options object for passing additional options to [changes-stream](https://github.com/jcrugzz/changes-stream). If passed a string, that will be used for the `db`.
* `options.db` **{String}**: The couchdb database to get changes from.
* `options.since` **{Number}**: Optionally specify the seq id to start from. This seq id will not be included in the stream.
* `options.limit` **{Number}**: Optionally specify a limit to how many changes are returned. Once the limit has been met, the stream will end.
* `returns` **{Stream}**: Returns a stream to be used in a pipeline

**Events**

* `emits`: `current` When the stream has caught up to the current seq, the seq will be emitted.

**Example**

```js
changes('https://skimdb.npmjs.com/registry')
 .on('current', function(seq) {
   console.log('caught up to the current update', seq);
 })
 .pipe(through.obj(function(file, enc, next) {
   console.log(file.seq, file.id);
   //=> 123456 'some-package-name'
   next(null, file);
 }));
```
